# nicetable

I created this R package to make summary tables quickly and easily for statistical consulting projects. 
The nicetable function creates a decent looking summary table similar to the Mayo clinic SAS table macro. 
The function returns a dataframe. The function also prints an html table by default for use in R markdown documents. 

I have tested this function out quite a bit and have fixed things along the way. 
There may still be some situations which lead to unexpected behavior or crashing - 
if you contact me I will most likely try to fix it. 
I make updates and add features as I need them and try to make everything backwards compatible.

This was my first R package and I used the following resources to get everything up and running:
